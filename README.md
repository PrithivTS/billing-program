# billing-program

Billing Program is a custom made software for making bills of sales and purchase. The program was written after the GST in India came into practice. This software package was written using HTML, Javascript and JSP. 
Instead of utilizing SQL databases, etc., this software package uses simple file handling to perform the required actions.
